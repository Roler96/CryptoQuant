### 2026-06-25: Signal-sparse trend-following strategies
**Problem:** All 3 strategies (DonchianEnsemble, SupertrendRegime, VolContractionRSI)  
produced ≤5 trades in a full year of 1h data. Gate requires ≥30 trades.
**Root causes:**
1. Entry conditions too strict (binomial voting with 7 channels, ADX regime gate, BB squeeze + RSI)
2. Once in a losing trade, never re-entered — exit condition too conservative
3. Lookback periods too long (720 bars = 30 days for Donchian) relative to 365-day window
**Lesson:** Relax entry conditions. Target 50-200 trades/year for statistical significance.
Shorten lookbacks for 365-day window (max 168 = 7 days).

## Parameter Sensitivities
- DonchianEnsemble: `lookbacks` dominated — needs shorter max lookback (168 instead of 720)
- SupertrendRegime: `factor=3.0` too wide — consider 2.0
- VolContractionRSI: `squeeze_pct=10` too strict — only traded 3 times
